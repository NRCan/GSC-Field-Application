# Geological Survey Canada Field Application

Geological Survey Canada on-site data collection application for geologists. This application automatically stored locational data for each location created and allows data entry of complex geological data. 

The GSC Field Application only records bedrock geology data at this time, but we will be extending it to include surficial data in the near future.

## Installation

The application is side-loaded onto any Windows 10 PC that meet sthe build requirement. More information coming later.
