This folder contains classes to convert data used in view models into data that can be rendered inside the view. Those classes are called inside the XAML files and used along a given variable found in the view model to actually parse the value into somehting usefull for the view itself. For example lat/long values can be converted into degree minutes seconds with proper symbols inside the output text value.
