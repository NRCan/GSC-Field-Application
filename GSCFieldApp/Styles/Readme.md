This XAML file is used to define every component styles in the app. Like colors, brushes, labels defitions for mandatory fields or for notes, some other controls default behavior. If a note text control needs to be updated, by changing it in here once makes all the other note text controls changed at the same time. Some controls behavior are meant to be default but more specific behavior could be set when used in dark or light mode, like font colors.
