Dictionaries contains classes in which all constant strings used throughout the app are found. By having all string stored at the same place we only have one place to update if needed.

*   **ApplicationLiterals.cs** contains keyword string used in the views for inherit functionalities.
*   **DatabaseLiterals.cs** contains all names of field and tables found in the field database model (sqlite). Those names are used throughout the whole application.
